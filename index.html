            <h2>Effective Sales Starts With Effective Systems & Process
            </h2>
            <p style="font-style:italic">Use the right process and your business grows
                Use the wrong process and sooner or later your business will suffer.</p>
              <p>Now, each of your sales people hopefully has a sales process they’re using. After all, you hired them for a reason.</p>
               <p> But just because they’re “placing orders” with callers who are ready to buy doesn’t mean they’re using the most effective sales process possible and capable of overcoming objections when they encounter a buyer who is shopping around.</p>
               <p>Some might be functioning as glorified order takers doing the same thing as everyone else in the industry: pitching features and leveraging coupons and discounts.</p>
               <p id="bold">But is “good enough” really “good enough?”</p>
               <p>I hope not. And if you’re still not convinced, I have just one question for you:

            <h2>Even Seasoned Sales Reps Need Direction
            </h2>
            <p>I’ve been working with and helping salespeople, sales managers and company owners take their game to a higher level for a long time.</p>
              <p> And, I’ve seen every type of salesperson. From A-players at the top of their game to salespeople who couldn’t sell ice cream on a 90 degree day when they started out, but eventually got better.</p>
             <p> All of them had the same needs: they all needed an effective process to follow, to be held accountable, and to get support and encouragement.</p>
               <p>The new reps needed to be trained, the legacy reps needed refreshers, and all of them needed someone to keep an eye out on their performance to prevent them from falling into an unproductive routine and following the path of least resistance.
                And that’s exactly why I’ve created this course.

          <h2>How Much Are You Spending to Acquire Each Inbound Lead?
        </h2>
          <p id="bold">$200? $300? $500?</p>
           <p>Depending on the competition in your area, I’ve seen numbers ranging $150 to $500 per lead.</p>
           <p>And when you’re spending that much per lead, don’t you want to make sure you’re making the most out of each and every single lead?</p>
           <p>Don’t you want to make sure that each of your sales people is using the most effective sales process possible and not one they randomly put together?</p>
           <p> Or do you want to leave this to chance?

          <h2>The Complete One-Call Close Process
          </h2><br>
          <p>Your sales people have the hard job of setting the right expectations, handling objections, and showing exactly how you’re different from the competition - all on the first call!
          </p>
          <p>And there’s a concrete, 5-step process they can use that I’ve observed six figure sales reps in the lawn care & pest control business using to consistently perform at the top of their game. After listening to over 2,000 sales calls, working with dozens of teams, and being in sales for nearly 4 decades I've fine tuned and documented this process that you can now leverage. 
          </p>
          <p>And this course goes through each step of the process in detail.</p>
          <p>Whether they’re a seasoned sales rep or a new hire ready to get out there and crush it, this course will give them the confidence, tools, and knowledge to help you make the most out of your marketing dollars - and help your sales reps make more money for themselves and their families.

    <h2>Here’s how the process works:
    </h2><br>
<button class="accordion"><h3>Module One:  Understanding the One Call Close</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In this module you’ll discover the 5 phases every salesperson must go through to engage the buyer, understand their needs, handle their objections and close the sale. You’ll also get a glimpse into how the A Players in this business - those earning a handsome six figure income year after year - think and act. 
</p><br>
  <p>And finally, you will gain insight into the 4 personality styles of different buyers to make establishing rapport and gaining trust much easier. 
</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"><h3>Module Two:  The Discovery Phase – Asking the Correct Questions
</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>This module will flip your entire sales process upside down and destroy the common belief that the sales presentation is where the magic lies. 
</p><br>
  <p>You’ll see not only why the Discovery Phase is the most important part to your selling success, but also the exact process to getting a super clear understanding upfront of how challenging the buyer’s situation is, exactly what they want to accomplish and how motivated they are to take action now.
</p><br>
  
</div>

<button class="accordion"><h3>Module Three:  Building Value - Presenting Your Ideas, Suggestions & Solutions 
</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>In Module Three you will learn an interesting and engaging approach to presenting your solutions to fixing the buyer’s problems and issues while avoiding the dreaded “feature dump.”
    </p><br>
    <p>Module Three will give you insight into how to personalize your presentation and keep your buyer engaged. You’ll gain an understanding of how to differentiate yourself from your competition, sending the buyer the message that you and your company are clearly their best choice.
    </p><br>
</div>
<button class="accordion"><h3>Module Four:  The Close - Handling Hesitations, Overcoming Objections
</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Module Four is a powerhouse filled with the tactics you need to effectively handle buying objections, including the four most common objections in this business: “I need to discuss it with my spouse.” “I want to think it over and I’ll get back to you.” “I want to get several more estimates.” “Your price is too high.”
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Overcoming objections is where a professional salesperson makes the big bucks. This is the phase of the sales process where sales tactics and persuasion combine to lead the buyer to make a decision to move forward.
        </p><br>
     
</div>

<button class="accordion"><h3>Module Five:  Personalized Persistence - Effective Follow Up
</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>In Module Five you will gain insight into how to follow up with an unsold estimate while continuing to provide value to your buyer.
    </p><br>
    <p>For those buyers who are on the fence and have not yet selected a provider it’s imperative that you continue to keep them involved in the sales process and illustrate to them that you truly care about them and want to help every step of the way.
    </p><br>
    <p>Module Five will help you continue to build credibility & trust and differentiate yourself and company from the competition.
    </p> 
  
</div>

<button class="accordion"><h3>Module Six:  Bonus Module – Commercial Pest Control Sales
</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Module Six is a bonus module focused on commercial pest control sales and will provide you with powerful insights in how to stand out and differentiate yourself in the crowded commercial pest control market.
    </p><br>
    <p>In this module you’ll take your game up a notch through learning tactics and commercial sales best practices in the areas of prospecting, qualifying, presenting, handling objections and closing.
    </p><br>
    
</div>
<button class="accordion"><h3>Module Seven:  Bonus Module – Managing Your Sales Team 
</h3></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Module Seven is a bonus module designed to help sales managers gain insight into how to create a culture of accountability and peak performance.
    <p></p><br>
  <p>The sales management position is the most important of any in the sales organization as a result of your direct and frequent contact with every member of your sales team. This module will provide you with the information you need to develop your sales organization to be one of your company’s most powerful competitive advantages.

        <h2>Hi, I’m Duane Cashin</h2>
        <p> I’ve been in sales for 38 years and in that time I’ve had the privilege of building successful sales organizations at multiple Fortune 500 companies and starting my own company where we created the first ever banner displayed on the front of Radio City Music Hall. 
      </p>
        <p>I went $900,000 in debt to start that company and even my accountant thought I was making a huge mistake, but he didn’t know what you and I know: sales is a superpower. If you can sell, and sell well, you can always build a successful business.
      </p>
        <p>That’s why I’ve been a lifelong student of sales -- I’ve studied all the greats and I’ve taught students and professionals in organizations large and small.  
      </p>
        <p>Long story short—I understand sales and sales management, and I love it. 
          About a decade ago I fell in love with lawn care and pest control (yes, really!). I started speaking at conferences and getting requests to help sales teams in this niche and I quickly learned what worked in the most successful lawn care and pest control companies. 
          </p>
          <p>I’ve combined that knowledge with my experience to create a highly effective sales process that helps companies like yours increase revenue, retention and market share - and I’m sharing this process here with you and your team.

              <h4>Why should I invest in this online course?
            </h4>
            <p>The Lawn Care & Pest Control industries are very crowded. Notice I did not say competitive! I have listened to over 2,000 sales calls and have noticed a recurring theme, the vast majority of salespeople in these industries wing it. They rely on their personality and a “feature dump” to close business.
            </p>
            <p>That approach is not competitive! Many reps burn through leads in the busy season relying on your marketing dollars to drive inbound calls from homeowners that are ready to buy. They explain your programs to the buyer, give them a price and the buyer says “get me on the schedule”.
            </p><br>
            <p>If the buyer says “I need to discuss it with my spouse, can you email the estimate over to me and I’ll get back to you?” The reps says: “happy to” and that’s the end of the call with no attempt to overcome the objection. The rep knows in a minute or so the phone will ring with a caller who is ready to buy. This is order taking and not professional selling. This is customer service behavior not sales professionalism and they are throwing your marketing dollars right out the window. This course will change all that and enable you to build a sales force that becomes your company’s number one competitive advantage. When your salespeople learn and execute six figure one call close strategies & tactics you will create a competitive gap between you and your closest competitor that will be extremely difficult for them to close!
            </p>
            <h4>How do I know this course will work for my sales team?
            </h4>
            <p>This online sales training course has been specially designed for the Lawn Care & Pest Control industries.
